# FabstirDB

## Introduction

FabstirDB is a TypeScript package that serves as an interface API for storing data in a graph database using OrbitDB, which is powered by IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Based off of GUN API, this package provides a scalable solution for developers who want to leverage the benefits of decentralized storage and graph databases.
Future expansion to include support for alternative infrastructure of S5 and Sia storage.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the API, interfaces, functions, and modules used in the project for a graph database interface similar to GUN API that uses OrbitDb as its backend.

#### `user` Object

The `user` object is a key part of the API, providing methods for user management, including creation, authentication, data retrieval, session management, and access control.

#### Interface: `Node`

The `Node` interface represents a node in the database, providing methods for data retrieval, sending data to the server, adding unique items to a list, fetching data, and performing a one-time operation.

#### Function: `createDBClient`

This function creates a database client with a specified base URL and an optional user public key. It returns an object with methods for data retrieval.

#### Module: `GlobalOrbit`

This module exposes a global OrbitDB instance that implements the `user` graph and `Node` database interfaces. It includes a `dbClient` instance and functions to update and reset this client.

## Example

This code block demonstrates user creation, authentication, granting write access, and data manipulation in a database using dbClient.
Only the logged in user can write to their user graph unless that user grants access to other users; in this example `addWriteAccess` is used to specify that another user can have write permission to a subgraph area "test".

```
user.create("username1", "mypassword1")
const userPub1 = user.is.pub
user.leave();

user.create("username2", "mypassword2")
const userPub2 = user.is.pub

await user.addWriteAccess(`users/${userPub1}/test`, userPub1);
user.leave();

user.auth("username1", "mypassword1")
await dbClient
  .user(userPub2)
  .get("test")
  .get("1")
  .put({message: "hello world"});
user.leave();

user.auth("username2", "mypassword2")
const dataEntries = await dbClient.get('test').load();
const data = dataEntries[0];
user.leave();

user.auth("username1", "mypassword1")
const dataAgain = await dbClient.user(userPub2).get('test').get('1').once();

console.log(data.message); // "hello world"
console.log(dataAgain.message); // "hello world"
```

  - **Parameters**:

    - `alias` _(string)_: The alias of the new user.
    - `pass` _(string)_: The password of the new user.
    - `cb` _(function)_: A callback function to be called with the result of the operation.

  - **Throws**: Will throw an error if the registration fails.

## Installation and Setup

1. Install dependencies and build the package:

   ```
   yarn install
   yarn build
   ```

2. Create a `.tgz` file for the package:

   ```
   yarn pack
   ```

   This will generate a `fabstirdb-lib.tgz` file in the current directory, which can be used for local installation or distribution.

3. Add the `.tgz` file as a dependency in your project:

   In your consuming project's `package.json`, add the following entry under `dependencies`:

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "fabstirdb-lib": "file:./path/to/fabstirdb-lib.tgz"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `./path/to/fabstirdb-lib.tgz` with the relative path to the `.tgz` file.

4. Install the dependency in your project:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

5. Set up the `FABSTIRDB_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to point to your running instance of FabstirDB-Backend.

6. Import and use the library in your project:

   ```javascript
   import { createDBClient } from 'fabstirdb-lib';

   const dbClient = createDBClient(
     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FABSTIRDB_BACKEND_URL,
   );
   const user = dbClient.user();

   user.create("username1", "mypassword1");
   ...
   ```

## Path

As with GUN API, single path string is different to a chained path. Take for example `gun.get("player").get("inventory/weapons").put("sword");` is not the same as `gun.get("player").get("inventory").get("weapons").put("sword");`

## Footnote

The interface to FabstirDB is based on GUN API. To use GUN itself, please go to [GUN API Documentation](https://gun.eco/docs/API)
